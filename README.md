This code simulates an autonomous parking system. The vehicle starts at position (0,0), scans the environment, and randomly selects a parking spot as its destination. While navigating, it continuously checks for obstacles—if one is detected, it pauses and reroutes; otherwise, it moves step by step closer to the spot along the x and y directions. Once it reaches the target, the vehicle aligns itself and completes the parking process, marking the car as parked. The entire sequence—spot detection, navigation, and parking—is executed through the self_park() method.
